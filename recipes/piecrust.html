    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>185g / 5.6 oz flour (plain / all-purpose flour)</li>
      <li>2 tsp white sugar (skip if making savory pie)</li>
      <li>0.5 tsp salt</li>
      <li>115 g unsalted butter, cold, cut into 1 cm / 1/3" cubes</li>
      <li>2.5 tbsp ice-cold water (+ more as required)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Make Dough:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Pulse Dry:</strong> Place flour, sugar, and salt in a food
        processor. Pulse twice to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cut in Butter:</strong> Scatter butter across the surface. Pulse
        5 times until the largest pieces are the size of chickpeas.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add Chilled Water:</strong> With the motor running on low, pour
        2.5 tbsp of water into the tube feeder.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Form Crumbs:</strong> Keep blitzing for 10 seconds until crumbs
        form (also see video). Pinch between fingers - they should stick and
        form a dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>HAND Option:</strong> Whisk flour, sugar, and salt in a large
        bowl. Rub butter into flour with the tips of fingers until it resembles
        crumbs - it should look the same as using a food processor. Then mix in
        cold water with a rubber spatula, then proceed with steps below.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Form Disc:</strong> Tip crumbs out onto a work surface, bring
        together into a dome (don't knead), pat into a 2cm/4/5" thick disc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chill:</strong> Wrap in cling wrap then refrigerate for 1 hour
        (up to 2 days, otherwise freeze).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Rolling Out:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Dust with Flour:</strong> Sprinkle the work surface with flour,
        unwrap dough and place on the flour. Sprinkle top with flour, dust
        rolling pin with flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Roll Out:</strong> Roll out into a round that's 10cm/4" larger
        than a 22.5cm/9" pie tin. Patch up and roll over cracks as necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Transfer to Pie Dish:</strong> Gently roll the pastry so it
        wraps around the rolling pin. Unroll it over the pie dish. Drape pastry
        into pie tin (do not stretch/pull, causes shrinkage).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Trim:</strong> If making a pie with NO LID (like Pumpkin Pie),
        trim edges with scissors leaving a 1 cm / 2/5" overhang. If making a pie
        with a lid (like a Meat Pie), trim edges so they align with the edge of
        the pie tin (i.e., no excess overhang).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tuck Excess Under:</strong> If applicable (i.e., per step above,
        if making a no-lid pie). Then crimp or decorate edge as desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Refrigerate:</strong> Put pie crust in the freezer for 15-30
        minutes (while oven heats up). This helps prevent shrinkage, firms up
        the butter again (flakiness!), and helps to ensure decorative crimped
        edges remain intact.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baking Options:</strong> (Note 4) - Blind bake the pie crust if
        it will be baked once filled (eg Meat Pie, Pumpkin Pie). Fully bake the
        pie crust if it will not be baked once filled.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Blind bake (par-bake, Note 4):</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan).</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Line & Weigh Down:</strong> Place 2 large pieces of
        parchment/baking paper crosswise over the pastry, then fill with baking
        beads or lots of rice or dried beans to weigh it down.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake 1 Covered:</strong> Bake for 15 minutes, then remove from
        oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake 2 Uncovered:</strong> Use excess paper to CAREFULLY remove
        hot beads, then return to the oven for 5 minutes or until the base is
        light golden (doesn't need to be 100% cooked though).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cool:</strong> Remove from oven. Cool 15 minutes in the pie tin
        before filling (another measure to avoid soggy base).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Fully Baked Option (Note 4):</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Follow directions per Blind Baking steps above BUT bake at 190°C/375°F
        (170°C fan) covered with baking beads for 25 minutes, then 15 minutes
        uncovered until golden. Fully cool before filling.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Recipe Notes:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Cold Butter:</strong> The key to flaky, crumbly pie crusts is to
        end up with teeny tiny bits of cold butter throughout the pastry when it
        goes into the oven. The butter melts and creates air pockets, making the
        pastry flaky. Butter softens and melts as you work with it, which is why
        there are refrigeration steps and the recipe specifically calls for cold
        butter and cold water. If it's warm where you are, and it takes you
        longer than 5 - 7 minutes to roll out the dough, press into the tin,
        crimp edges, and get it into the oven, refrigerate the dough for 15
        minutes or so before baking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pie Weights:</strong> Pie weights stop the base from puffing up
        and help reduce pastry shrinkage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baking the Pie Crust:</strong> If the pie will be filled and
        baked (e.g., Pumpkin Pie or Pecan Pie), follow the blind baking
        directions. The crust will be partially baked, enough to prevent the
        base from going soggy, and will finish baking with the filling. If the
        pie will be filled with something that will not be baked (like chocolate
        cream pie filling), then the crust needs to be fully baked.

        <strong>Different Measures in Different Countries:</strong> The measures
        in this recipe work with both US and metric (rest of world!) measures.
      </li>

        <strong>Source:</strong> Knowing me, it was probably originally sourced
        from New York Times, Cooks' Illustrated, or America's Test Kitchen (that
        would be typical of me), but it's now written exactly how I do it, and
        there's every chance ingredients were marginally tweaked to what I think
        is the perfect balance!
