    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Koftas:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb / 500 g lamb mince (ground lamb)</li>
      <li>1/2 onion, grated</li>
      <li>1/4 cup breadcrumbs, preferably panko</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Kofta Spices:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tsp cumin</li>
      <li>2 tsp coriander</li>
      <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
      <li>1.5 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>
        3/4 tsp cayenne pepper (this is a bit spicy, reduce to taste or leave
        out)
      </li>
      <li>1 tsp cooking / kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Yoghurt Sauce:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup yogurt, Greek or other thick plain</li>
      <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
      <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp salt and pepper, each</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>To Serve:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>8 skewers (Note 1)</li>
      <li>
        8 flatbreads (small) or 4 large, warmed (homemade or bought, Note 2)
      </li>
      <li>Shredded Red Cabbage, Carrot and Mint Salad (Note 3)</li>
      <li>OR shredded lettuce, tomato and onion slices (Note 3)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Make Dough:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Yoghurt Sauce:</strong> Combine the yogurt sauce ingredients and
        leave in the fridge for at least 20 minutes for the flavor to develop
        (overnight is even better!).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Koftas::</strong> Grate the onion into the bowl using a standard
        box grater. Add remaining Kofta ingredients and mix well with your
        hands.
      </li>
      <li>
        With damp hands, divide the meat into 8 equal pieces and push and shape
        the meat onto 8 skewers. Make them smooth (looks nicer, pictured!) or a
        bit nubbly (more surface area to brown!).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Cooking:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Stove:</strong> Preheat 1/2 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Cook in batches for 5 minutes in total, turning to brown evenly all over.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>BBQ:</strong>BBQ on medium high for about 6 minutes, rotating to brown all over.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Broiler/Oven grill:</strong> preheat and cook koftas 30cm/10" from heat source for 12 minutes, rotating as needed until lightly browned (you won't get as good a browning as stove/BBQ).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Serving:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Do a DIY spread - pile everything onto a platter a make everyone serve themselves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Get a flatbread, smear with Yogurt Sauce, top with Red Cabbage Mint Salad (more options Note 3) then Kofta, drizzle over more Yoghurt Sauce. Devour and be happy!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Recipe Notes:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Soak Skewers:</strong> If using wooden or bamboo skewers and planning to cook on a BBQ grill or under a broiler/oven grill, soak for 30 minutes prior to threading meat on. If using metal skewers, and cooking on the stove or the plate side of the BBQ, there is no need to do this.</li>
        <li><strong>Flatbread:</strong> Any flatbreads that can be wrapped around the koftas will work well here. If using small pita breads, stuff each one with 2 koftas (this is enough for a normal meal), or use 1 kofta per pita. Large flatbreads (like Lebanese bread) can be used to make 1 long wrap. You could also make your own – try these Easy No Yeast Flatbreads!</li>
        <li><strong>Salad for Stuffing:</strong> I usually make this Red Cabbage Mint Salad, which complements the koftas beautifully. Other options include:
            <ul>
                <li>Shredded iceberg lettuce (or leafy greens) with slices of tomato and onion (similar to Doner Kebabs), fresh coriander/cilantro, parsley, or mint.</li>
                <li>Tabbouleh – see recipe in Doner Kebab recipe.</li>
                <li>Seasoned Middle Eastern Lentil Rice Pilaf (Mejadra) – a tasty side or stuffing for pitas.</li>
                <li>Middle Eastern Chickpea Salad with Cucumber and Tomato (omit chickpeas if preferred) – great juicy crunch factor.</li>
                <li>Hummus instead of or in addition to yogurt sauce.</li>
                <li>Juicy marinated BBQ Vegetables – excellent to stuff into pitas with the koftas.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
