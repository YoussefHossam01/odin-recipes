# odin-recipes
This is my first project in "The Odin Project" foundation course, where the task at hand is
to create a simple recipe website showcasing the HTML skills I've learned so far. 
This website will strictly demonstrate HTML, hence it won't be presentable.

UPDATE 19/9/2024:
Some basic CSS styling is added, just testing out CSS.

UPDATE 20/9/2024:
Further CSS styling for homepage; box model related.
